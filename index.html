                <p> From the title my name is Allan and I was raised in Australia. I graduated from UNSW with a
                    Bachelors
                    in Commerce (Majors in Finance and Accounting) in 2016. Ever since then I have been working in
                    various companies in the Accounting department.
                </p>
                <p> When I joined my previous company as an junior
                    accountant, I realised that there were so many changes I could make to their Excel sheets which were
                    outdated and everyone had to manually enter in everything. I spent a few lunchbreaks fixing up all
                    that which could be automated through VBA and generic Excel code. It was when I realised that
                    figuring out how to code and debug things kept me my sanity and after which I decided to look
                    towards Computer Science or Software/Web development as a future career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently still work full time as an Accountant however I'm hoping that after this bootcamp I can
                    start building my portfolio through freelancing or through creating my own projects. After I have a
                    solid portfolio, I'll look into trying to obtain internships or seeing if I can get a full time job
                    within a coding related field.
